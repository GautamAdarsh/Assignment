		<p>On 3rd March, 2022 I first started working on the navigation bar making it responsive with a hamburger icon. After I had finished the nav part, I then started working on designing the home page. I chose the color and design wisely which would look attractive to the viewers.I gave my webpages bluish looks and worked on the contact page and finished that part too.</P>
		</div>
		<div class="item2">
		<p>On 4th March, 2022 I started working on the Portfolio page and this blog page. The portfolio page didnt seem to be responsive and I had no clue why it was not responsive. Then I started rechecking all the pages and th epage which was olny left to complete was the site report page.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="item3">On 6th March, 2022 finally I completed my Site report page. Then I added the screen shots of validation and did the referencing and hence I finished my assignment successfully with a video demonstration at the end.</div>
