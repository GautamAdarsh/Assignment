		<h1>Site Report</h1>
		<p><h3>Only few years ago I came to know about all these web development, designs and codings and also I had tried to do the codings but then I had gave up cause I had not understood it properly before. But since I joined the Bsc Software Engineering at NAMI, I started getting in touch with the codings, designs and development concepts and ideas. Now currently I have got much more knowledge than before cause of more practical knowledge and skills after I joined the University. The first web assignment given by the University have improved my skills and knowledge much more in web development, designs and coding.</h3><p>
		
		<p><h3>From the CSY1018 module, We have finished the HTML and CSS part and now our teacher has started the new Java part. My experience of the module is that I have came to know alot of elements, tags, attributes, values and properties of HTML and CSS. I can now use my knowledge in creating a website and designing it through the css file. I am very much excited for the Java part.</h3><p>
		
		<p><h3>I had no clue at the beginning about how I should start my assignment and design it. But then later as the submission date was getting close I made the decision of giving my website bluish vibes. Then I made my website bluish with abit golden coloured fonts which seemed to be very suitable with the navy blue colour. I separated the navigation and body by giving dark navy blue color to the navigation bar and abit lighter one to the body which i think looks really nice. The home page I kept it simple with some texts describing about me and also a footer. Then for the portfolio page I gave the heading and then made the background color skyblue for the image placeholder part to match the bluish looks. Then for the contact page I made it simple and responsive with the users email launch program as said by the University. In the contact page I gave the hover effect for the send button and then made everything else simple and fine. Then for the blog I have used the grid column property and separated in three parts for the three entries where I have written the blog in three entries with skyblue background to again maintain the bluish looks. Then i made this site report page very simple with the contents and have shown the screen shots of validation showing my HTML and CSS pages validate. </h3><p>
